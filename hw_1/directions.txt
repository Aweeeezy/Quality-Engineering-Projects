Directions
==============================================================================

You will write a short (quite) program that - given three integer values x, y
and z (as lengths of the sides of the triangle) that

Will determine if x, y, and z form a triangle
If yes then it will determine if the triangle is
Equilateral
Isosceles or
Scalene
The program should be written with testing ease in mind. Pay attention to how
it is documented, commented, structured etc. This program may sound trivial
which makes it difficult to elaborate on documentation.

Write as many test cases as you can think of. Documenting test cases is
important and you can follow the format given in the lecture slides but put the
test cases in a nice tabular format. Make sure to add a row that explains the
reason a particular test is written.

I am not very fond of setting definitive numbers as goals such as a number of
pages for a report or a number of test cases for this assignment. You should
write a reasonable number of test cases. When we grade, we will look for
whether the number adequately covers enough scenarios or covers questions that
arise while we think about testing this program.

We will revisit this very same program and write test cases for it again
towards the end of the semester. At that time we will make use of all the
concepts we studied and compare with what we are doing now. It will be
interesting!

Note: This is a team assignment (as most assignments in this class are) and
only one submission per team should be sufficient. Please do all work in 12
point font and double space.
